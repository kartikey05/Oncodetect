🔬 **Understanding Logistic Regression:**

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, such as detecting the presence or absence of breast cancer in this project. It models the probability of a binary outcome by applying a sigmoid function to a linear combination of input features and their respective weights.

🎯 **Why Oncodetect?**

- **Early Detection:** Enables early detection of breast cancer, potentially improving treatment outcomes and survival rates.
- **Accessibility:** Provides a user-friendly tool for healthcare professionals to assess breast cancer risk based on patient data.
- **Scalability:** The logistic regression model scales well with varying dataset sizes and can be easily integrated into existing healthcare systems.
